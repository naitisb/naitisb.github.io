Hello, thanks for stopping by! My name is Naiti [IPA: neÎ¸i]. Broadly, I'm excited about the intersection of cognitive development and artificial learning. While I'm most drawn to formalizing computational models to characterize children's social , I'm also eager to get involved in using our understanding of child development to craft better algorithms of artifical intelligence.

I'm currently working on my MSc in Psychological Research at the University of Edinburgh, where I am advised by [Hilary Richardson](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/hilary-richardson). Next year, I'll begin my PhD in Psychology here. For my PhD, I will continue to study the structural and functional changes in neural mechanisms as related to the development of theory of mind reasoning (FMI, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind) or [Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/theory-of-mind).


I graduated from Scripps College in May 2021, where I majored in Computer Science and Neuroscience, advised by [Tessa Solomon-Lane](https://tessasolomonlane.com/) and [Julie Medero](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~julie/). My senior thesis explored object categorization in infant visual scenes, and was supervised by [Bria Long](https://www.brialong.com/), [Michael C. Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/), and [John G. Milton](http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/jmilton/). After graduation, I moved to Manhattan and worked as a lab manager at the [Hartley Lab](www.hartleylab.org) at New York University, where I was involved in various projects formalizing models of learning and decision-making as they change over development.

I completed two NSF-funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates: over the summer of 2019 at the University of Minnesota, I did research with [Katie Tregillus](http://engellab.psych.umn.edu/people/katherine-tregillus) and [Steve Engel](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/engel) in the [Engel Vision and Imaging Lab](http://engellab.psych.umn.edu/), and over the summer of 2020 at Stanford University's Center for the Study of Language and Information, I remotely worked with [Bria Long](https://www.brialong.com/), [George Kachergis](http://www.kachergis.com/), and [Mike Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/) in the [Language and Cognition Lab](http://langcog.stanford.edu/).

I grew up in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, USA.
