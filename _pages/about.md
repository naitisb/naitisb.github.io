Hello, thanks for stopping by! My name is Naiti [IPA: neÎ¸i]. I am currently a fourth year student at Scripps College, majoring in Computer Science and Neuroscience, where I am advised by [Tessa Solomon-Lane](https://tessasolomonlane.com/) and [Julie Medero](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~julie/). I'm working on my senior thesis, exploring object categorization in infant visual scenes, which is supervised by [Bria Long](https://www.brialong.com/), [Michael C. Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/), and [John G. Milton](http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/jmilton/).

I am broadly excited about the intersection of cognitive development and artificial learning, specifically with respect to perceptual learning and pattern recognition.

I completed two NSF-funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates: over the summer of 2019 at the University of Minnesota, I did research with [Katie Tregillus](http://engellab.psych.umn.edu/people/katherine-tregillus) and [Steve Engel](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/engel) in the [Engel Vision and Imaging Lab](http://engellab.psych.umn.edu/), and over the summer of 2020 at Stanford University's Center for the Study of Language and Information, I remotely worked with [Bria Long](https://www.brialong.com/), [George Kachergis](http://www.kachergis.com/), and [Mike Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/) in the [Language and Cognition Lab](http://langcog.stanford.edu/).

I grew up in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, USA.
